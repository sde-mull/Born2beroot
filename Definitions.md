## How a virtual machine works?

-> Virtual machines are made possible through virtualization technology. Virtualization uses software to simulate virtual hardware that allows multiple VMs to run in a single machine. Thephysical machine is known as the host while the VMs running on it are called guests.
-> This process is managed by software known as hypervisor. The hypervisor is responsible for managing and provising resources (like memory and storage) from the host to guest. It also schedules operations in VMs so they don't overrun each other when using resources.
